This is my (optional) code submission for the 2023 Jane Street SEE program @ Hong Kong.

Remarks:
* 93.5%+ win rate with [1, 2, 11, 3, 4, 15, 22, 22, 17, 3]
* Given more time, I would have created more combinations for opponent_soldiers.txt to further test my hypothesis (in no way were entries of opponent_soldiers.txt fabricated to lose, some were constructed around other strategies and others deterministic)
* Since [10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10] has an 86% win rate from opponent_soldiers.txt, and this arrangement of soldiers should average around 50%(?), we may hypothesise that the win rate of [1, 2, 11, 3, 4, 15, 22, 22, 17, 3] may be inflated, but will still perform better than the “average”
